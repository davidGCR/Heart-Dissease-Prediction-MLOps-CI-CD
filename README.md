## Heart Dissease Prediction with MLOps good practices and CI/CD pipelines

This project presents a classifier to predict heart dissease usig the Kaggle dataset: [Kaggle heart disease](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaanboke/beginner-friendly-catboost-with-optuna/notebook) . Solving this problem in production, at scale, is difficult. The intention behind this project is to  propose an approach to build a quick solution delivering production-quality code using best-practices for MLOps.
